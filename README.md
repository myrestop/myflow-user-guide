# Welcome To Our MyFlow User Guide

In this documentation, you will learn our general rules and MyFlow's tips.

### Introduction

MyFlow is a powerful efficiency tool that can be combined with many plugins, and it running based on keywords, a keyword mean a feature.

You can alse pin a keyword to the tab(if keyword support), doing this you don't need always input the keyword to trigger the feature.

### General Constraints

The example usage in the plugin description page, you may see some special character, like `[]|{}`, `[]` means an optional parameter, `|` means or,  `{}` means a parameter need user input. And all the usage cases are based on the default keyword.

> example: `timer [{name}] {date}` means name is a optional parameter, but you must input a date parameter to start a timer.

In searching action, `?` means match one any character, `*` means match any number of characters.

### Hotkey Tips

`Alt` is a magic hotkey, you can press it to refresh the result(if result support), or open the result context menu(if result has multi operations).

In result list, press `Tab` to get the selected result suggestion text.

##### Switch Pinned Keyword

Use `Alt+LEFT` switch to the previous pinned keyword, `Alt+RIGHT` switch to the next pinned keyword.

And you can also use `Ctrl+{number}` switch to the specified indexed pinned keyword, like `Ctrl+0` switch to the first, `Ctrl+1` switch to the second, `Ctrl+9` switch to the last pinned keyword. And in here, `Alt` has another wonderful usage, press with `Alt`, whether the action window is visible or not, it always show, for example: `Ctrl+Alt+2`, app will show the action window and switch to the third pinned keyword even if it is hidden.

> In macos, the `Ctrl` is instead by `Command` key.

### Other Tips

- At action input field, you can drag text or file(ensure the action window is pinned)
