### Hotkey Tips

`Alt` the magic feature, you can press it to refresh the result if the result support, or open the result context menu if the result has multi operations.

How to switch pin keyword fast? Of course use shortcuts, use `Alt+LEFT` switch to the previous pinned keyword, `Alt+RIGHT` switch to the next pinned keyword.

Has any others faster way? Yes, you can use `Ctrl+{number}` switch to the specified indexed pinned keyword, like `Ctrl+0` switch to the first, `Ctrl+1` switch to the second, `Ctrl+9` switch to the last pinned keyword. And in here, `Alt` has another wonderful usage, press with `Alt`, whether the action window is visible or not, it always show, for example: `Ctrl+Alt+2`, app will show the action window and switch to the third pinned keyword even if it is hidden.
